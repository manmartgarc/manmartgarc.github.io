      <description>This is a working paper with Tomas Larroucau, Christopher Neilson and Ignacio Rios. The paper explores how information and beliefs have an effect on outcomes within the tertiary education market in Chile, which is a centralized college admissions system.

The abstract is below, and you can find the latest version of the working paper here.</description>
