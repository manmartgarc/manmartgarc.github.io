      <description>TLDR -&amp;gt; You can view my CV here
 Currently I am a first year CAPP candidate at the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy. I also work as a data scientist and occasionally as a data engineer for ConsiliumBots, an NGO that leverages economic theory and technology to make navigation in education markets easier for families and students.
Previously I was a Predoctoral Fellow (a synonym for research assistant) at Yale&amp;rsquo;s Tobin Center for Economic Policy for Christopher Neilson and John Eric Humphries where I developed tools to assist the research team and performed statistical data analysis.</description>
