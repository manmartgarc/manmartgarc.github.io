      <title>Recommender Systems: Content-based Filtering</title>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;content-based-filtering&#34;&gt;Content-Based Filtering&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paradigm is very straightforward. It uses item features to recommend other items similar to what the user likes, based on their previous actions or explicit feedback. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; There are many approaches to defining similarity, and implicitly, this is how we are defining pertinence. That is, we think that items that are similar to other items that the user has seen in the past are pertinent to that user based on whatever &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1314/posts/content-filtering/content-based/#similarity-metrics&#34;&gt;similarity&lt;/a&gt; we have chosen.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the first post in what I plan to be a series of very basic introductions to recommendation engines, and the most basic ones at that. I am by no means an expert, or even a middling practitioner, but just a neophyte, so the series will not be exhaustive. The real purpose of these posts is to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.colorado.edu/artssciences-advising/resource-library/life-skills/the-feynman-technique-in-academic-coaching&#34;&gt;learn by explaining&lt;/a&gt;, but also to allow you to hit the ground running if you want to set up a basic recommendation system for your purposes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
