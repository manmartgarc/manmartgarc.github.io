      <description>This is the second week of the third course of DeepLearning.AI&amp;rsquo;s Deep Learning Specialization offered on Coursera. This course is less technical than the previous two, and focuses instead on general principles and intuition related to machine learning projects.&#xA;This week&amp;rsquo;s topics are:&#xA;Error Analysis Carrying out Error Analysis Cleaning up Incorrectly Labeled Data Build our First System Quickly, then Iterate Mismatched Training and Dev/Test Sets Training and Testing on Different Distributions Bias and Variance with Mismatched Data Distributions Addressing Data Mismatch Learning from Multiple Tasks Transfer Learning Multitask Learning End-to-end Deep Learning What is End-to-end Deep Learning?</description>
