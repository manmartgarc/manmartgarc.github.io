      <description>This is the fourth and last week of the fourth course of DeepLearning.AI&amp;rsquo;s Deep Learning Specialization offered on Coursera. In this week we go over special applications in the field of computer vision with CNNs, face recognition and neural style transfer. This week introduces new important concepts that will be useful even beyond the context of CNNs.
This week&amp;rsquo;s topics are as follows:
 Face Recognition  What is Face Recognition?</description>

      <description>This is the third week of the fourth course of DeepLearning.AI&amp;rsquo;s Deep Learning Specialization offered on Coursera. The week focuses on object detection and localization, important applications of computer vision where CNNs serve as a building block to more specialized applications.
This week&amp;rsquo;s topics are:
 Object Localization Landmark Detection Object Detection  Sliding Windows Detection Convolutional Implementation of Sliding Windows  Turning fully connected layers into convolutional layers Implementing sliding windows convolutionally   Bounding Box Predictions  Intersection Over Union Non-max Suppression Anchor Boxes     Semantic Segmentation  Transpose Convolutions U-Net Architecture     Object LocalizationLink to headingObject localization is, intuitively, not just detecting an object in an image, but also being able to describe its position in the image.</description>

      <description>This is the second week of the fourth course of DeepLearning.AI&amp;rsquo;s Deep Learning Specialization offered on Coursera. This week is largely a literature review, going over different architectures and approaches that have made large contributions to the field.
This week&amp;rsquo;s topics are:
 Case Studies  Classic Networks  LeNet5 AlexNet VGG16   ResNets  Why do ResNets Work?   Networks in Networks | 1x1 Convolutions Inception Network  Inception Network Architecture   MobileNet  Depth-wise Convolution Point-wise Convolution MobileNet Architecture     Practical Advice for Using ConvNets  Transfer Learning Data Augmentation     Case StudiesLink to headingWe should obviously keep up with the computer vision literature if we are interested in implementing new ideas.</description>
