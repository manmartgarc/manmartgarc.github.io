      <description>This is the first week in the second course of DeepLearning.AI&amp;rsquo;s Deep Learning Specialization offered on Coursera. The course deals with hyperparameter tuning, regularization and the optimization of the training process. The optimization ranges from computational complexity to performance. This is again a pretty technical week where you will benefit a lot from doing the programming exercises.
