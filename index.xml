      <description>This is a working paper with Ana√Øs Fabre, Tomas Larroucau, Christopher Neilson and Ignacio Rios. The paper explores how information and beliefs have an effect on outcomes within the tertiary education market in Chile, which is a centralized college admissions system. The paper includes two waves of surveys done in 2019 and 2020 and an RCT done in 2021 with both government and NGOs. The abstract is below, and you can find the latest version of the working paper here.</description>
